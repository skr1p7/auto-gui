[NOTE: The script is written in python3, to make it work in python2.7, you need to install the Tkinter library
and tweak the shebang in the script i.e. the first line that goes by #!/usr/bin/python3
and change it to #!/usr/bin/python2]


To add the GUI automation appliaction, all we had to do is copy the script to the /bin location by using
the following command;

$ sudo cp -i ~/auto-gui/auto.py /bin

where *auto-gui* directory is the directory created when we clone the repository

After completing the above step successfully, we have to setup a new CRON Job, for that we
have to use the following command;

$ sudo crontab -e

This will ask for the administrator password and will open a text file in GnuNano,
after scrolling to the bottom of the text file, we'll ad the following line to the text file
and save it

$ @reboot python /bin/auto.py &

In the above commmand, we have to specify the path of the python script i.e. in the /bin folder and the (&) symbol
means that this job will not alter with the boot sequence.
